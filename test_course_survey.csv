However this does not apply to this lecture. The lectures were narration of slides, I got no tangible understanding of the course, tutorials were fine but did not seem to help me in understanding the course. The comment from the professor that he is disappointed with the midterm results and that we should ""work harder"" and attend the lectures is insensitive and inaccurate. Physicists had quantum at 8am with average of around 15 participants and MAA301 course that follows quantum almost never had more than 10 attendants (out of the entire promotion!) - Not because we are lazy but because the lectures were indeed useless - Throughout the year this is the class I probably worked the most for because I had to effectively teach myself the entire subject (even though I went to lectures) and this is the first course where I thought to myself, it is not my approach or knowledge that is letting me down it is just the way how the course is given that makes it very difficult to progress on the understanding of the subject.  Overall, a very disappointing course."
